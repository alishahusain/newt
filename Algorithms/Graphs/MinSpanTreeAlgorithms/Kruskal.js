// difference between krushkal's algorithm and dijkstra's algorithm
// dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from one node to another
// kruskal's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree

// difference between a minimum spanning tree and a shortest path
// a minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

// difference between a minimum spanning tree and a minimum spanning forest
// a minimum spanning forest is a collection of minimum spanning trees

// difference between dijkstra's algorithm and prim's algorithm
// dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from one node to another
// prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree

// difference between prim's algorithm and kruskal's algorithm
// prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree
// kruskal's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree

// prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm
// kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm

// difference between prim's algorithm and kruskal's algorithm : prim uses a priority queue and kruskal uses a sorted list


// whats the difference between a greedy algorithm and a dynamic programming algorithm
// a greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum
// a dynamic programming algorithm solves each subproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table


// whats the difference between a greedy algorithm and a divide and conquer algorithm
// a greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum
// a divide and conquer algorithm breaks down a problem into subproblems of the same type, recursively solves the subproblems, and then combines the solutions to the subproblems to solve the original problem
